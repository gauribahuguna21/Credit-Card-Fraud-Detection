# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using various machine learning algorithms. It uses a dataset with anonymized features and class labels indicating fraudulent or valid transactions.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- Built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning libraries such as:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Performance evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Curve

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
